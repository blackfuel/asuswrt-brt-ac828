	D. BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU AND TREND MICRO AGREE THAT IF YOU AND TREND MICRO DO NOT RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BY INFORMAL NEGOTIATION AS SET FORTH ABOVE, ANY EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE WILL BE CONDUCTED EXCLUSIVELY BY BINDING ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES SET FORTH BELOW. YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BY AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE (OR PARTICIPATE IN AS A PARTY OR CLASS MEMBER) ALL DISPUTES IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. INSTEAD, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, WHOSE DECISION WILL BE BINDING AND FINAL, EXCEPT FOR A LIMITED RIGHT OF APPEAL UNDER THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT. ANY COURT WITH JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTIES MAY ENFORCE THE ARBITRATOR'S AWARD. THE ONLY DISPUTES NOT COVERED BY THE AGREEMENT TO NEGOTIATE INFORMALLY AND ARBITRATE ARE DISPUTES ENFORCING, PROTECTING, OR CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OF ANY OF YOUR OR TREND MICRO’S (OR ANY OF YOUR OR TREND MICRO’S LICENSORS) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.<br>
	E. SMALL CLAIMS COURT. Notwithstanding the above, You have the right to litigate any Dispute in small claims court, if all requirements of the small claims court, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at issue in the Dispute, are satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, You agree to bring a Dispute in small claims court only in Your county of residence or Dallas County, Texas.<br>
	F. CLASS ACTION WAIVER. TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, YOU AND TREND MICRO AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION, IN COURT, OR OTHERWISE, WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND THAT NEITHER YOU NOR TREND MICRO WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, A COLLECTIVE ACTION, A PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY PROCEEDING IN WHICH YOU OR TREND MICRO ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. YOU AND TREND MICRO FURTHER AGREE THAT NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE JOINED, CONSOLIDATED, OR COMBINED WITH ANOTHER ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF YOU, TREND MICRO, AND ALL PARTIES TO ANY SUCH ARBITRATION OR PROECCEDING.<br>
	G. ARBITRATION PROCEDURE. The arbitration of any Dispute will be conducted by and according to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"). Information about the AAA, and how to commence arbitration before it, is available at www.adr.org. If You are an individual consumer and use the Software ore Premium Support Services for personal or household use, or if the value of the Dispute is $75,000 or less, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes of the AAA will also apply. If the AAA rules or procedures conflict with the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement will govern. You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the AAA rules and procedures. Where the value of a Dispute is $10,000 or less, any hearing will be through a telephonic hearing unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing. The arbitrator has the power to make any award of damages to the individual party asserting a claim that would be available to a court of law. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party asserting a claim, and only to the extent required to provide relief on that party's individual claim.<br>
	H. ARBITRATION LOCATION. You agree to commence arbitration only in Your county of residence or in Dallas County, Texas. Trend Micro agrees to commence arbitration only in Your county of residence.<br>
	I. COSTS AND ATTORNEY'S FEES. In a dispute involving $75,000 or less, Trend Micro will reimburse for payment of Your filing fees, and pay the AAA administrative fees and the arbitrator's fees and expenses, incurred in any arbitration You commence against Trend Micro unless the arbitrator finds it frivolous or brought for an improper purpose. Trend Micro will pay all filing and AAA administrative fees, and the arbitrator's fees and expenses, incurred in any arbitration Trend Micro commences against You. If a Dispute involving $75,000 or less proceeds to an award at the arbitration after You reject the last written settlement offer Trend Micro made before the arbitrator was appointed ("Trend Micro's Last Written Offer"), and the arbitrator makes an award in Your favor greater than Trend Micro's Last Written Offer, Trend Micro will pay You the greater of the award or $1,000, plus twice Your reasonable attorney's fees, if any, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that Your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing Your claim in arbitration, as determined by the arbitrator or agreed to by You and Trend Micro. In any arbitration You commence, Trend Micro will seek its AAA administrative fees or arbitrator's fees and expenses, or Your filing fees it reimbursed, only if the arbitrator finds the arbitration frivolous or brought for an improper purpose. Trend Micro will not seek its attorney's fees or expenses from You. In a Dispute involving more than $75,000, the AAA rules will govern payment of filing and AAA administrative fees and arbitrator's fees and expenses. Fees and expenses are not counted in determining how much a Dispute involves.<br>
	J. IF CLASS ACTION WAIVER ILLEGAL OR UNENFORCEABLE. If the class action waiver (which includes a waiver of private attorney-general actions) in Section 27F (class action waiver) is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, whether by judicial, legislative, or other action, then the remaining paragraphs in Section 27 will not apply to those parts. Instead, those parts of the Dispute will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration. The definition of "Dispute" in this section will still apply to this Agreement. You and Trend Micro irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts in Dallas County, Texas, USA, for all proceedings in court under this paragraph.<br>
	K. YOUR RIGHT TO REJECT CHANGES TO ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Trend Micro agrees that if it makes any change to Section 27 (other than a change to the notice address) while You are authorized to use the Software or Premium Support Services, You may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change by U.S. Mail to the address in Section 27C. By rejecting the change, You agree that You will informally negotiate and arbitrate any Dispute between us in accordance with the most recent version of Section 27 before the change You rejected.<br>
	L. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of Section 27 and its subsections, other than Section 27F (class action waiver), is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed from Section 27, but the remainder paragraphs of Section 27 will remain in full force and effect. Section 27J says what happens if Section 27F (class action waiver) is found to be illegal or unenforceable.
	<br><br>
	28. GENERAL. This Agreement and specifications regarding number of Computers and Subscription Term constitute the entire agreement between You and Trend Micro. Unless the Software and/or the Premium Support Services are subject to an existing, written contract signed by Trend Micro, this Agreement supersedes any prior agreement or understanding, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is found invalid, that finding will not affect the validity of the remaining parts of this Agreement. Trend Micro may assign or subcontract some or all of its obligations under this Agreement to qualified third parties or its affiliates and/or subsidiaries, provided that no such assignment or subcontract shall relieve Trend Micro of its obligations under this Agreement.
